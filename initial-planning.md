Track income/expenses via terminal
Save data to CSV files
Practice Python basics and file handling
Good first blog post: "Building a CLI Finance App in Python"


Personal Portfolio Website

Display in browser
Add location search
Practice Python, APIs, and basic JS
Great for teaching API integration


Task Management System


User authentication
CRUD operations
Database integration
Good stepping stone to larger projects

## Learning Structure
Learning Structure:

Active Recall + Spaced Repetition


Code for 45-minute focused sessions
Take a 5-10 minute break
At the end of each session, write down:

What you learned
What confused you
Questions that arose


Review these notes before starting your next session


Project-Based Learning Loop


Watch/read tutorial (20 minutes max)
Immediately build something similar (1 hour)
Try to modify/extend it without help (30 minutes)
Document struggles and solutions
Review others' code doing similar things

Documentation System:

Daily Quick Notes (15 minutes)


Use Obsidian or Notion
Template:
markdownCopy# Date
/## What I Built Today
/## Key Concepts Learned
/## Roadblocks & Solutions
/## Tomorrow's Goals



Weekly Blog Post (1 hour)


Transform daily notes into structured content
Include:

Code snippets that gave you trouble
Screenshots of your progress
Links to resources that helped
Your thought process and solutions




Code Organization


Keep a GitHub repository for each project
Write detailed README files
Comment your code thoroughly
Use conventional commits for version control


Progress Tracking


Take screenshots of your work regularly
Record short screen captures when solving problems
Keep a running list of completed features/functionalities
